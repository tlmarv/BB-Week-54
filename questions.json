    "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of pain and numbness in her right hand, which worsens at night. She describes 'pins and needles' in her thumb, index, and middle fingers. On physical exam, tapping on the wrist elicits tingling in these fingers. Nerve conduction studies show prolonged latency to first deflection. Which of the following fiber types is most likely affected in this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "A-alpha",
      "A-beta",
      "A-delta",
      "B fibers",
      "C fibers"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient has classic signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, which compresses the median nerve and affects sensory fibers innervating the lateral three and a half digits. A-beta fibers are myelinated with medium-large diameters and are responsible for tactile sensations via cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Delayed conduction velocity in these fibers is diagnostic. A-alpha fibers are motor or proprioceptive. A-delta and C fibers transmit pain and temperature. B fibers are autonomic.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man sustains a penetrating stab wound to the left side of his spinal cord at the T8 level. Neurologic exam shows loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation on the left side below T8, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side below T10. Which of the following tracts is most likely damaged on the right side?",

      "Left anterior spinothalamic tract",
      "Right spinocerebellar tract"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This is classic Brown-Sequard syndrome. The lesion on the left side affects the ipsilateral dorsal column, leading to left-sided proprioception and vibration loss. The right lateral spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature from the left side, is affected due to crossing over within a few segments of entry. Other tracts listed are either on the wrong side or responsible for different modalities.",

      "Compression of the dorsal root ganglia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Syringomyelia damages the anterior white commissure, where decussating spinothalamic fibers cross. This leads to bilateral segmental loss of pain and temperature in a 'cape-like' distribution. The anterior horns are motor. Posterior columns mediate vibration and proprioception. Medial lemniscus and dorsal root ganglia lesions would produce different patterns of deficits.",

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This is classic for syringomyelia, which affects the anterior white commissure where the second-order spinothalamic fibers decussate. This leads to a 'cape-like' distribution of pain and temperature loss. Dorsal columns mediate vibration/proprioception, which is spared. Anterior horns produce motor deficits; lateral corticospinal tracts cause spasticity; medial lemniscus carries fine touch and proprioception centrally.",

Neurological exam reveals decreased pinprick and temperature sensation in a stocking distribution, with preserved vibration and proprioception. Which of the following best explains the underlying pathophysiology affecting his sensory function?",
  "choices": [
    "Demyelination of large myelinated Aβ fibers",

    "Ischemia of the posterior spinal arteries"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with diabetic small fiber neuropathy, which primarily affects unmyelinated C fibers and thinly myelinated Aδ fibers responsible for pain and temperature sensation. This results in burning or tingling pain with preserved proprioception and vibration (mediated by large Aβ fibers). Choice 0 is incorrect because large fiber demyelination would lead to loss of proprioception, not burning pain. Choice 2 refers to motor neuron diseases like ALS. Choice 3 and 4 would cause dorsal column signs like impaired proprioception and vibration, which are not present here.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Oligodendrocytes are responsible for myelinating axons in the CNS. In multiple sclerosis, autoimmune destruction of oligodendrocytes leads to demyelination while initially sparing axons. Astrocytes (choice 0) provide support and repair.

      "Low MAC value",
      "High oil:gas partition coefficient",
      "Low blood:gas partition coefficient",
      "High rate of hepatic metabolism"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The blood:gas partition coefficient reflects how soluble an anesthetic is in blood. A low coefficient means the agent is less soluble, allowing alveolar partial pressure to rise quickly, which correlates with a faster onset of action. Sevoflurane has a low blood:gas partition coefficient (0.69). High solubility (choice 0) slows onset. MAC (choice 1) relates to potency, not speed. Oil:gas coefficient (choice 2) relates to potency. Hepatic metabolism (choice 4) does not determine onset.",

      "Sevoflurane",
      "Isoflurane",
      "Nitrous oxide"

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Sevoflurane is non-pungent and causes significant bronchodilation, making it ideal for patients with reactive airway disease. Desflurane and isoflurane are airway irritants. Halothane is no longer widely used due to toxicity. Nitrous oxide is neither a potent bronchodilator nor suitable for induction alone.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This is malignant hyperthermia, a life-threatening reaction to volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine. Dantrolene is the definitive treatment; it acts by inhibiting calcium release via ryanodine receptors in skeletal muscle. Naloxone (choice 1) treats opioid overdose. Increasing anesthetic (choice 2) worsens the condition. Beta-blockers (choice 3) are not first-line. Atropine (choice 4) is used for bradycardia, not malignant hyperthermia.",

      "Selective inhibition of GABAergic interneurons in the spinal cord"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of CNS toxicity from local anesthetics like lidocaine. A rapid rise in plasma concentration blocks inhibitory pathways in the cerebral cortex, leading to unopposed excitation and seizures. NMDA receptors (choice 0) are not involved in this mechanism. Hypersensitivity reactions (choice 2) are more common with ester anesthetics due to PABA metabolites. Bupivacaine (choice 3) is not used here.

      "Tetracaine",
      "Lidocaine",
      "Cocaine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Lidocaine is an amide anesthetic primarily metabolized in the liver. Patients with liver dysfunction are at increased risk of systemic toxicity due to slower metabolism. Procaine, chloroprocaine, and tetracaine (choices 0, 1, and 2) are esters metabolized by plasma cholinesterases.

      "Rapid hydrolysis in plasma by pseudocholinesterase"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Bupivacaine at low concentrations exhibits differential blockade, meaning it preferentially blocks sensory nerves while sparing motor function, making it ideal for labor analgesia. Lipid solubility and pKa (choice 0) affect onset and potency but not sensory preference. It has high protein binding and long duration (contradicting choice 1). It does not selectively block sympathetic fibers (choice 2). As an amide, it is metabolized hepatically, not via plasma hydrolysis (choice 4).",

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Ginkgo biloba can inhibit platelet aggregation and platelet activating factor, increasing bleeding risk without affecting INR. Valerian (choice 0) is a sedative and does not affect coagulation. Garlic (choice 1) can have antiplatelet effects but is less associated with intracranial hemorrhage in clinical practice.

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a classic case of migraine. Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, is effective for abortive therapy. Propranolol (choice 0) and amitriptyline (choice 4) are used for prophylaxis. Gabapentin (choice 2) is not first-line abortive therapy. Ergots (choice 3) are older agents with more side effects and are less preferred than triptans.",

      "Asthma",
      "Celiac disease",
      "Ischemic heart disease",
      "Migraine with aura",
      "Pregnancy"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Triptans, which are selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, are contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease due to their vasoconstrictive effects. Asthma (choice 0) and celiac disease (choice 1) are not contraindications. Migraine with aura (choice 3) is not an absolute contraindication, although caution is advised in hemiplegic or basilar migraines. Pregnancy (choice 4) requires risk-benefit analysis but is not an absolute contraindication.",

      "Hypertension",
      "Drowsiness and xerostomia",
      "Weight gain and fatigue",
      "Hyperkalemia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Gepants, such as ubrogepant and rimegepant, block CGRP receptors and are associated with drowsiness, dry mouth (xerostomia), and nausea. Serotonin syndrome (choice 0) is more common with serotonergic agents. Hypertension (choice 1) and hyperkalemia (choice 4) are not typical. Weight gain and fatigue (choice 3) are associated with some antidepressants and antiepileptics used for prophylaxis, not CGRP antagonists.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old man with frequent migraines is placed on topiramate for prevention. Two months later, he complains of difficulty concentrating and tingling in his fingers. Which of the following best explains the mechanism of this drug's antimigraine effect?",
    "choices": [
      "Inhibition of serotonin reuptake",
      "Cleavage of SNAP-25",

      "5-HT1F receptor agonism",
      "Inhibition of nitric oxide production"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Topiramate exerts its prophylactic antimigraine effect by antagonizing AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors and enhancing GABA activity. Serotonin reuptake inhibition (choice 0) is the mechanism for antidepressants. SNAP-25 cleavage (choice 1) is the mechanism for botulinum toxin. 5-HT1F receptor agonism (choice 3) applies to lasmiditan. Inhibition of nitric oxide production (choice 4) is associated with beta-blockers.",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer is prescribed morphine for severe bone pain. He soon experiences excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Which of the following best explains the molecular mechanism responsible for morphine’s analgesic and respiratory depressant effects?",
    "choices": [
      "Opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels",

      "Opening of K+ channels and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase",
      "Blockade of NMDA receptors"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Opioid receptors (particularly μ) are Gi/Go protein-coupled and reduce neuronal excitability by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, closing presynaptic Ca2+ channels, and opening postsynaptic K+ channels. This reduces neurotransmitter release and hyperpolarizes neurons. Ca2+ channels (choice 0) are closed, not opened. Gq signaling (choice 1) is not involved in opioid signaling. Glutamate release (choice 2) is inhibited, not enhanced. NMDA blockade (choice 4) is not a primary mechanism for morphine.",

      "Acetylcholine receptor antagonism",
      "Serotonin depletion in the brainstem"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Meperidine is metabolized to normeperidine, which is neurotoxic and can accumulate in patients with renal impairment, causing CNS excitation including seizures. Dopamine blockade (choice 0) is more typical of antipsychotics. Naloxone (choice 2) can cause withdrawal but not seizures. Anticholinergic toxicity (choice 3) would present differently. Serotonin depletion (choice 4) causes depression, not seizures.",

    "choices": [
      "Full agonist at μ-opioid receptors",
      "Partial agonist at μ and κ-opioid receptors",
      "Partial agonist at μ-opioid and antagonist at κ-opioid receptors",
      "Antagonist at μ-opioid receptors",
      "Full agonist at δ-opioid receptors"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Buprenorphine is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist and κ-receptor antagonist. This combination allows for analgesia and treatment of opioid dependence with less respiratory depression and abuse potential. It is not a full agonist (choice 0), nor does it agonize κ-receptors (choice 1). Naloxone provides antagonism, not buprenorphine alone (choice 3). δ-receptor agonism (choice 4) is not the mechanism of buprenorphine.",

    "question": "A 75-year-old man presents with acute bilateral leg weakness and loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the umbilicus following thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. His proprioception remains intact. Which of the following spinal cord syndromes is most consistent with these findings?",

      "Brown-Séquard syndrome",
      "Posterior cord syndrome",
      "Central cord syndrome",
      "Anterior cord syndrome",
      "Cauda equina syndrome"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Anterior cord syndrome results from infarction or compression of the anterior spinal artery, which supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. This includes motor pathways (corticospinal tracts) and the spinothalamic tracts but spares the posterior columns (proprioception, vibration). Brown-Séquard (A) involves hemicord injury with asymmetric findings. Posterior cord syndrome (B) presents with isolated proprioceptive loss. Central cord syndrome (C) mainly affects upper extremities. Cauda equina (E) involves LMN signs and saddle anesthesia.",

    "question": "A 70-year-old woman with long-standing diabetes presents with progressive weakness in her hands and arms. She denies trauma. Neurologic exam shows decreased strength and reflexes in the upper extremities, mild lower extremity weakness, and preserved proprioception and vibration. MRI reveals a small syrinx at the cervical level. Which of the following best describes her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Posterior cord syndrome",
      "Central cord syndrome",
      "Brown-Séquard syndrome",
      "Complete cord transection",
      "Cauda equina syndrome"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Central cord syndrome often results from hyperextension injury or syringomyelia, especially in older adults. It affects the medial corticospinal fibers that innervate the upper extremities more than the lower extremities, explaining the disproportionate arm weakness. Sensory involvement may be mild or variable. Posterior cord syndrome (A) affects proprioception and vibration. Brown-Séquard (C) presents with asymmetric deficits. Complete transection (D) causes bilateral, complete loss of function. Cauda equina (E) affects lower extremity LMNs.",

      "Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right leg",
      "Loss of fine touch and vibration sense in the left leg",
      "Loss of fine touch and vibration sense in the right leg",
      "Bilateral lower extremity weakness"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The dorsal columns carry proprioception, vibration, and fine touch ipsilaterally. A right-sided lesion at T10 will affect these modalities on the same (right) side below the lesion. Pain and temperature fibers cross immediately upon entering the spinal cord, so choices 0 and 1 are incorrect. Bilateral motor weakness (choice 4) would require corticospinal tract damage.",

      "Loss of motor control on the right side of the body"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The medial lemniscus carries second-order neurons that have already decussated from the dorsal column nuclei and convey vibration and proprioception to the thalamus. A left medial lemniscus lesion causes right-sided deficits in vibration and proprioception. Pain and temperature deficits on the right (choice 2) would require a spinothalamic tract lesion. Motor control (choice 4) involves corticospinal tract injury.",

    "question": "A 65-year-old man recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease is referred to occupational therapy. In an initial session, the therapist focuses on the patient’s values, daily routines, and goals, rather than prescribing a fixed regimen. Which of the following best describes the guiding principle of occupational therapy illustrated in this scenario?",
    "choices": [
      "Biomedical model focused on strength and flexibility",

      "Prognosis-driven physical performance testing",
      "Standardized mobility enhancement protocol"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Occupational therapy (OT) prioritizes a holistic, client-centered approach that considers a patient’s values and desired activities rather than just medical diagnosis or physical impairments. Unlike the biomedical model (choice 0), OT emphasizes meaningful occupations. Choice 1 is more aligned with traditional medical models. Choices 3 and 4 imply more rigid or standardized protocols, which are inconsistent with OT’s individualized strategy.",
